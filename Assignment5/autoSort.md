## Auto Sorting List

For the sorting:

1. insert: The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because in the worst-case scenario, the function might have to traverse the entire list to find the correct position to insert the new node.

For the searching:

2. search: The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. The function might have to traverse the entire list to find the target value (or to determine that the value is not in the list).

For the removing:

3. remove: The time complexity is also O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. Similar to the insert function, in the worst-case scenario, the function might have to traverse the entire list to find the node to remove.

Yikes, some bad O optimization from me.
