### Complexity

- Add Vertex: O(1) - Appending to a vector.
- Add Edge: O(1) - Appending to the edges vector of a vertex.
- Shortest Path Algorithm (Dijkstra's Algorithm): O((V + E) \* log(V)) - Priority queue operations dominate.
- Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm (Prim's Algorithm): O((V + E) \* log(V)) - Priority queue operations dominate.
