### Based on what we know about linked lists, stacks, and queues, design a queue data structure:

1. What functions are we likely to need for a queue to function like the one discussed in class?

For our queue, we will need a function to add a value to the beginning of the queue, delete a value from the end of the queue, and a way to print out the current queue.

2. What values will we need to know about the structure for our queue to function properly?

We will need to know the size of the queue, the value at the front of the queue, and the value at the end of the queue.

3. Based on what we know about linked lists, design a list data structure that allows us to add (insert) or remove (delete) values at a given location in the list (instead of the top of a stack or the front or back of a queue):

4. What functions are we likely to need for a list to function like this?

5. What values will we need to know about the structure for our list to function properly?

See design.cpp file in this directory.

Commit changes to your design into your git repo frequently while designing (in an obvious assignment 2 folder or repo),
(Also remember to double check that I am a collaborator on your project or the git repo is otherwise accessible by the instructor)
