### Five things I find interesting about Computer Science

1. Data engineering: I love the concept of taking large amounts of cluttered data and cleaning it into a useable format.
2. Parallel processing: I love having my programs do multiple things at once, it's very satisfying seeing my program run 5 times faster when I split up the tasks.
3. Data scraping: I love scraping for data and compiling it, it itches my brain in a good way.
4. Code Golf: I love the idea of making my code as short as possible, it's like a puzzle. One that I'm not good at yet. But still fun!
5. Physics simulations: I love the idea of making a program that can simulate the real world, especially in terms of things like racing cars.

### Five things I find challenging about Computer Science

1. Pointers and references: Yeah, I still don't really grasp this and it makes my head hurt everytime.
2. Data Structures: I attempted this class once and found it really overwhelming to grasp it all. I want to get good at it.
3. Function Complexity: I'm still not great at figuring out how to make my functions as efficient as possible. The O notation is still a bit confusing to me.
4. Machine learning: This always goes over my head, especially when it dips into the hardware aspect of it. I just don't really grasp it and don't know where to start.
5. Hardware: This is one aspect of CS I am really not familiar with in any way, there is so much to it that it feels like an entirely different realm.
